## Installation Guide

### Install

```sh
npm ci
```

### Run Local Development

```sh
npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Static Build

```sh
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```sh
USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```sh
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to
build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
